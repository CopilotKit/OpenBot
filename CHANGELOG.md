# Changelog

What changed, for somebody deciding whether to upgrade. Written for the person running OpenBot, not
for the person who wrote the commit: a line belongs here when a deployment behaves differently
afterwards, and does not when only the code moved.

Newest first. `Unreleased` is what is on `main` and not yet tagged.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Releases are cut by a workflow, not by hand.** `Create release PR` bumps the version and promotes
  `## Unreleased` to a numbered section; merging the pull request it opens is what publishes. Merging
  builds and pushes one image to `ghcr.io/copilotkit/openbot`, signs a build provenance attestation
  for its digest, tags the commit and creates the GitHub Release with `container-images.json` so a
  deployment can name an exact digest rather than a tag somebody could move. See
  [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
- **CI now runs the thing it ships.** Three checks were added. `migrations` refuses a schema change
  with no migration written for it, and a snapshot that has drifted from the schema. `image` builds
  the container, boots it, and fails if it does not answer or if a supervised service is respawning.
  `smoke` runs the journey in `tests/smoke`, which existed and ran nowhere, against a real
  deployment. A single `verify` check covers all of them, so branch protection needs one entry.
- **One container that runs the whole thing.** The root `Dockerfile` builds an image carrying the
  app, the API, a Bot computer, and optionally PostgreSQL, supervised together. Point `DATABASE_URL`
  at a database you already run and the built-in one never starts; leave it unset and the container
  is self-contained. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the measured minimum sizes and
  the platforms it has been run on.
- **Bots can run commands.** `computer_run_command` runs a command in the Bot's `/workspace`, so a
  Bot can install a tool, unpack what it downloaded, or run what it was asked to run instead of only
  driving a browser. Governed like every other action: the policy decides, the audit row is written
  first, and a rule can refuse a shell outright with `intent == "run_command"` or refuse particular
  commands. The command is recorded; its output is not.
- **The audit trail shows the command.** A command row names what ran, the way a file row names the
  path, rather than reporting an element it was never about.
- **`COMPUTER_SANDBOX=on`** turns on Chromium's own sandbox where the host permits user namespaces.
  Which way it went is printed at start-up either way.

### Fixed

- **A deployment served over plain HTTP could not start a conversation.** The chat surface minted
  identifiers with `crypto.randomUUID`, which browsers withhold outside a secure context. On a
  laptop `http://localhost` counts as one, so this never showed up in development; on a real
  address it does not, and the surface did nothing at all when you pressed send. No message, no
  error. Ids now come from an API with no such restriction.

### Changed

- **Where a Bot's computer runs is now a plug.** One `ComputerProvider` interface sits under the
  gateway, with the Docker supervisor as one implementation and a shared computer as another. A
  computer somewhere else is an adapter rather than a change to the governed path. Thanks to
  [@mu-hashmi](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/pull/57) for the refactor.
- The address a provider hands back is checked before anything is sent to it, and the cloud metadata
  addresses are refused whatever a provider says.
- The container image runs as an unprivileged user rather than root.
