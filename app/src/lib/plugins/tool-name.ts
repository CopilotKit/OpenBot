   * singularised, and looked for as a contiguous run inside the label's words. Whole words in an
   * unbroken sequence, never a substring test: that is what let "Create routine routines" through in
   * the first place.

   * `humanise` always puts the verb first, and that leading word is excluded from the search:
   * `mcp__posts__post_message` singularises its server to "post", which is also the tool's own verb,
   * so without this exclusion "Post message" would lose its "posts" attribution over a coincidence
   * with the verb rather than a naming of the server. Same shape for `mcp__lists__list_files`
   * against "List". Only the words after the verb describe what the action was taken on, so only
   * those are eligible to match the server.
   *
   * This does not, and cannot, catch every collision: `mcp__news__get_new_items` singularises "news"
   * to "new", which genuinely is the second word of "Get new items", so the server is still dropped
   * there. English plural heuristics cannot tell that "new" apart from the "new" in "news" — that is
   * a known limit of this rule, not a bug to chase with a word list.
