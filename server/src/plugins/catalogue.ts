 * is a decision to make once, in review, rather than one to leave to whoever is typing a URL into an
 * admin page at the time. Only servers the vendor themselves maintains are here. A community server
 * that wraps the same API is not equivalent: it is an extra party in the trust path with none of the
 * accountability, and the answer for a vendor without an official server is to wait for one.
 *
 * Every host and path here comes from the vendor's published documentation. They are pinned rather
 * than discovered, because a URL this deployment will hand a credential to is a reviewed source
 * contract.
 *
 * Admissibility is fail-closed and checked against the pinned host, never against what a caller
 * supplied. A URL that does not exactly match a pinned host, or match one anchored per-instance
 * pattern, is refused. This is the control that stops "add an MCP server" from being a request
 * forgery primitive pointed at the deployment's own network.
