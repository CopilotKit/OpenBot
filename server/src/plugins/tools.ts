 * The tools a Bot may call, as the runtime's own tool definitions, executed on the server.

 * The loop used to run in the browser: every MCP tool was registered with `useFrontendTool` and its
 * handler posted back to `/api/plugins/call`. That made a browser a hard requirement for a Bot to do
 * anything, which rules out an embedded widget, a run nobody is watching, and any surface that is
 * not our own app.
 *
 * Nothing about governance moves with it. `callTool` is still the only path to a vendor: it checks
 * the grant, evaluates the policy, writes the audit row, and only then calls out. This module hands
 * the model a description of what it may call; the store remains what decides whether a call happens.
 *
 * Read at run time rather than captured, so a grant an administrator adds or revokes applies to the
 * next run rather than after a restart.
